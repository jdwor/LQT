\arguments{
\item{pat_ids}{a vector of strings specifying patients' IDs (used as directories for output files)}

\item{lesion_paths}{a vector of strings specifying the path to patients' lesion masks (pre-registered to MNI template, and corresponding to pat_ids)}

\item{out_path}{a string specifying the path to your desired output directory; patient and atlas result directories will be created here}

\item{dsi_path}{a string specifying the path to your local DSI_Studio program}

\item{parcel_path}{a string specifying the path to a parcellation map (should have identical dimensions to lesion and be in MNI template space);
function defaults to the Schaefer-Yeo 100 parcel 7 network parcellation with subcortical structures}

\item{file_suffix}{a string providing a suffix for results files; the atlas name is recommended (e.g. AAL, Power, Gordon, etc.)}

\item{con_type}{connectivity type (must be either 'end' or 'pass'): if 'end', connections are defined based on streamline endpoints;
if 'pass', they are based on streamline pass-throughs ('end' is more conservative and is recommended)}

\item{sspl_spared_thresh}{a number between 1 and 100 representing the percent spared threshold for computing shortest structural path lengths
(e.g. 100 means that only fully spared regions will be included in SSPL calculation, 1 means that regions with at least 1 percent spared will be included; default is 50)}

\item{node_label}{a vector of strings corresponding to node labels (i.e. parcel names); must be the same length (P) as the number of parcels}

\item{node_group}{a vector of strings integer values corresponding to e.g. network assignments or partitions (used to color nodes in visualizations)}

\item{parcel_coords}{a P-by-3 matrix of parcel coordinates used for brain network graphs; if not supplied, they will be estimated from the parcel file}

\item{delta_sspl_thresh}{a number between 1 and 100 giving the percentile threshold for displaying SSPL increases in figures (will only display SSPL increases above percentile threshold; default = 90)}

\item{parcel_dmg_thresh}{a number between 1 and 100 giving the parcel damage threshold for displaying SSPL increases in figures (will not display SSPL increases for parcels with percent damage greater than or equal to the threshold; default = 100)}

\item{tract_sdc_thresh}{a number between 1 and 100 giving the tract disconnection threshold for displaying tracts in figures (will not display data for tracts with percent disconnection below threshold; default = 5)}

\item{smooth}{a number representing the sigma (in mm) of the Gaussian kernel for smoothing the track density imaging output file (default = 2)}
}
\value{
A list structure to be input into downstream analysis functions.
}
\description{
This function compiles the relevant settings and file paths to be fed into analysis functions.
